I have worked on KNN and SVM by just only using train.csv file and splitting it into 80% and 20% ratio as you guided in class. 
Alot of Problem faced while working on KNN because it was time consuming and code was crashe sometimes. It is good for small data set this approch is not good for big data set because it was consuming  hours to execute. 

In SVM problem I was facing was liblinear was failing to converge and unable to print k fold accuracy scores then tried different values of i like 7 8 9 and 4 but i got 50% accuracy.
